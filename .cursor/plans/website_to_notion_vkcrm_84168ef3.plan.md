name: Website to Notion VKCRM
overview: "Integrate the site with the Notion VKCRM database for WRV requests and call bookings only: new VKCRM module with correct property mapping, de-duplication, and General notes; WRV form writes to VKCRM; lead submissions stop writing to Notion; call booking only creates/updates VKCRM via a new booking-confirmed webhook (form submit no longer writes to Notion)."
